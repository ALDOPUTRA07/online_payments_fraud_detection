<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Billions of Rupiah are lost due to online fraud every year, causing huge losses for users and the financial industry. Great attention has been paid to the search for techniques to avoid this significant loss of money. 

The project builds an application named “Online Payments Fraud Detection System using Artificial Intelligence”. In this application, we use machine learning (Random Forest) techniques for the detection of customer fraud.


**Note:** This project is still in Jupyter Notebook. The next step is to carry out the packaging and deploying code process.

### Built With

These are list any major frameworks/libraries used to make the project.

## Background

Online fraudulent transactions are a significant criminal violation. It costs people and the financial industry billions of dollars every year. It emphasizes the crucial importance of the financial industry in detecting and preventing fraudulent acts. Machine learning algorithms provide a proactive way mechanism to prevent online transaction fraud with high accuracy.

## How to Works
The steps followed to manage these goals:
- Selection of dataset
- Check the imbalanced target column
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature selection and feature engineering
- Training with Random Forest
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate the model (accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion metrics)

## Next Step 
In the next step, we can carry out the packaging and deploying code to be implemented in the production environment.
